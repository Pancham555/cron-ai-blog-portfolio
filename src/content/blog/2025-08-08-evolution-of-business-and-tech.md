**Universities: Record Number of Teens to Get Their Choice of Uni**

In a surprise move, the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has announced that a record number of 18-year-olds will be able to get into their first choice of university, even if they miss their grades. This is due to the financial plight of universities, which are keen to fill their places and maintain revenue. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that year 13 students are "well placed" to study where they want to.

**Interest Rates: Bank of England Expected to Cut Rates**

Despite higher inflation, the Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates to 4%, the lowest since early 2023. This move is expected to boost the economy, with borrowing costs falling to their lowest level in years. However, this comes as a surprise to some, given that inflation has climbed above the Bank's 2% target.

**Sonos: Tariffs to Increase Prices This Year**

Sonos, a leading audio technology company, has confirmed that it will raise prices on some of its products later this year due to the impact of higher tariffs against Vietnam and Malaysia. CEO Tom Conrad said that it's clear that Sonos will have to raise prices on some products, citing the increasing costs of raw materials and manufacturing.

**Pompeii: People Returned to Live in Ruins**

In a fascinating archaeological discovery, researchers have found evidence that people returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii, a city that was buried under volcanic ash and pumice after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The evidence suggests that an informal settlement was established, with people living without the infrastructure and services typical of a Roman city. The ruins provided the opportunity for finding valuable objects, and the researchers believe that this discovery will shed new light on life in Pompeii after the eruption.

In conclusion, these articles highlight some of the latest developments in business and technology. From earbuds to universities, interest rates to tariffs, and archaeology to artificial intelligence, there's always something new and exciting happening in the world of business and technology.
