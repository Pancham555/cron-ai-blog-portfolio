The BBC has uncovered an international network of content creators profiting from AI-generated posts on Facebook. These networks are mass-producing specific types of content, including Holocaust-related images, and selling them to unsuspecting buyers. The investigation found that Pakistani man Fazal Rahman, who is enrolled in several social media content monetization schemes, is one of the key figures behind this operation.

**Decoding the DNA of Ancient Oaks**

Scientists are using the DNA of Britain's ancient oaks to crack the secrets of their superpowers. The Druids Oak, an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, has been chosen for the study. Dr. Ed Pyne, a scientist involved in the project, believes that the ancient oaks' genetic makeup holds the key to understanding how they have thrived for so long. The research aims to develop more sustainable forest management practices.

The vaccine aims to reduce the risk of complications and hospitalizations.
