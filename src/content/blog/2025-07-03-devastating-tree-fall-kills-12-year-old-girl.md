**Girl Killed by Falling Tree in Southend Park**
---------------------------------------------

A devastating incident occurred in a Southend park when a tree fell and trapped five children underneath it. The tree, which was estimated to be around 100 years old, fell due to strong winds. Eyewitnesses reported that around 50 people, including some from a nearby cricket club, tried to lift the tree to free the children. Unfortunately, 12-year-old Leonna Ruka succumbed to her injuries, leaving her family and community in shock. The incident serves as a grim reminder of the importance of maintaining and inspecting trees, especially in public spaces.

**Bank of England to Redesign Banknotes**
-------------------------------------

In a significant development, the Bank of England has announced plans to redesign its banknotes for the first time in over 50 years. The decision marks a potential end to the tradition of featuring historical figures on notes. The bank has called for public input and suggestions on the design, which could lead to a more modern and diverse representation on banknotes. The Bermuda Monetary Authority's $5 note, which won the International Bank Note Society's banknote of the year award last year, features a predominantly pink design with images of a blue marlin, dolphins, and tuna fish. This redesign could be the start of a new era for banknotes in the UK.

**Diddy Trial: Jury to Keep Deliberating**
----------------------------------------

The trial of music mogul Diddy, who is accused of racketeering and other charges, has reached a verdict on four of the five counts. However, the jury was unable to reach a consensus on the most serious racketeering charge. The panel will continue deliberating to try to reach a verdict on this count. The trial has been closely followed by fans and the music industry, with many wondering what the outcome will mean for Diddy's career and reputation.

**UK Dry Weather: Will There Be a Drought?**
-----------------------------------------

The UK has experienced a particularly dry few months, with many areas experiencing below-average rainfall. River, reservoir, and groundwater levels are all being closely monitored, and experts are warning of the potential for drought. The National Farmers' Union has expressed concerns about the impact of the dry weather on agriculture, with Deputy Director Rachel Hallos stating that the situation is "quite shocking." As the summer months continue, it remains to be seen whether the dry weather will persist and lead to a drought.

**Israel Agrees to 60-Day Gaza Ceasefire**
-----------------------------------------

In a significant development, Israel has agreed to a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, according to US President Trump. The ceasefire is conditional, and it is unclear what the conditions will be or whether Hamas will accept them. Trump warned Hamas that if they do not accept the deal, the situation will only get worse. The announcement comes ahead of a meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ceasefire marks a potential step towards reducing tensions in the region.

In conclusion, these articles highlight a range of important issues, from environmental concerns to international politics. The incident in Southend park serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining public spaces, while the Bank of England's redesign of banknotes could signal a new era for currency design. The Diddy trial continues to unfold, with the jury still deliberating on the most serious charge. The dry weather in the UK has raised concerns about the potential for drought, and the Israel-Gaza ceasefire offers a glimmer of hope for reducing tensions in the region.
