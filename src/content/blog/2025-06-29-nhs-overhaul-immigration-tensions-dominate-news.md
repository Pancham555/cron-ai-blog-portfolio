In recent news, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is set to undergo a significant overhaul, with plans to scrap hundreds of quangos and introduce a new 10-year health strategy. According to the new head of NHS England, the health service has retained too many "fossilised" ways of working, which are hindering progress. This move is part of a broader effort to modernize the NHS and put patients at the forefront of decision-making.

Meanwhile, in the United States, the Supreme Court has delivered a significant blow to judicial power, limiting the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions. This decision is expected to give President Trump more leeway to carry out his agenda through executive orders, despite opposition from judges and other branches of government.

In related news, a shocking video has emerged showing immigration agents attempting to detain a woman in West Los Angeles. The woman, who was selling food outside a Home Depot, was chased by agents and managed to cling to a tree to avoid capture. This incident highlights the ongoing tensions and controversies surrounding immigration policy in the US.

In other news, the UK is bracing for a heatwave, with temperatures expected to soar. The heatwave is set to coincide with the publication of the government's 10-year health plan, which has been making headlines. According to The Times, the plan includes a proposal to link NHS funding to patient satisfaction ratings, with hospitals being paid more for providing better care.

In the world of politics, a key Republican congressman has announced that he will not seek reelection in 2026. GOP Rep. Don Bacon, who represents a swing district in Nebraska, has decided to retire, opening up a critical seat for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.
