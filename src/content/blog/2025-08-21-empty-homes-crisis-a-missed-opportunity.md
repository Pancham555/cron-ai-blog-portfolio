**Empty Homes Crisis: A Missed Opportunity?**

The UK is facing a severe housing crisis, with nearly 720,000 empty homes in England. Meanwhile, many more people are stuck on social housing waiting lists. In this context, using empty homes to address the shortage may seem like a no-brainer. However, some argue that this approach could have unintended consequences, such as disincentivizing councils from addressing the root problem of housing supply and demand. Councils may prioritize collecting the premium tax rates from empty homes over finding solutions to the housing crisis. This raises important questions about the effectiveness of using empty homes to solve the shortage.

The ASA ruled that the ad breached its broadcast code and was likely to cause offense to some viewers. This decision serves as a reminder of the importance of diversity and inclusion in advertising and the need for greater representation in the media.
