**Business and Artificial Intelligence News: Top Stories of the Week**

In a week filled with significant developments, the UK heatwave and plans to overhaul the National Health Service (NHS) dominated the headlines. Meanwhile, the Senate failed to advance an Iran War Powers resolution, and the music world mourned the departure of Anna Wintour as editor-in-chief of Vogue.

**UK Heatwave and NHS Overhaul**

The Times led the way with a story on the NHS, highlighting plans to "rewire" the health service by giving patients a greater say in how much hospitals are paid. Patients will rate their treatment experiences, which will influence funding allocations. This move aims to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs.

**Iran War Powers Resolution Fails in Senate**

In a closely watched vote, the Senate rejected a Democrat-sponsored resolution aimed at limiting the President's ability to use military force against Iran without congressional approval. The measure, led by Senator Tim Kaine, was met with opposition from Republicans, who argued it would undermine the President's authority.

**Glastonbury Festival and Anna Wintour's Legacy**

The 1975 delivered a polished but safe headline performance at Glastonbury, while Alanis Morisette, PinkPantheress, and Wet Leg impressed with their sets. Meanwhile, the fashion world was abuzz with the news of Anna Wintour's departure as editor-in-chief of Vogue after 37 years. Her legacy is complicated, and the question of her successor is still uncertain.

**Eric Adams Denies Deal with Trump**

In a CNN Politics exclusive, New York Mayor Eric Adams denied reports of a deal with former President Donald Trump to drop "bogus charges" in exchange for his support in Adams' 2025 re-election bid. Adams, who is running as an Independent, emphasized his commitment to his constituents and dismissed the rumors as "fake news."

These stories offer a glimpse into the diverse range of topics that dominated the news cycle this week. From the heatwave in the UK to the Senate vote on Iran War Powers, from the music festival at Glastonbury to the fashion world's reaction to Anna Wintour's departure, there is no shortage of interesting and important news to report.
