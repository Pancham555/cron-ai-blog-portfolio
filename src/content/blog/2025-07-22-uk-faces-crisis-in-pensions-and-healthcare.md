In recent news, the UK's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has warned that four-in-ten people are not saving enough for retirement, which could lead to future pensioners being £800 or 8% worse off per year than their counterparts today. This alarming trend is expected to continue, with people drawing their pension 25 years from now set to be significantly worse off. This news comes as the UK government considers the future of the pension system.

Meanwhile, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is facing a potential bill of £27bn for negligence in England since 2019, according to The Guardian. This news comes as doctors in the UK prepare to go on strike, with many papers focusing on the issue ahead of the planned five-day walkout. The strike has sparked concerns about the impact on patient care and the future of the NHS.

In other news, a national inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave has been confirmed by Yvette Cooper, following a 13-year campaign by the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign. The 1984 clash between police and striking miners in South Yorkshire was marked by violence and has had a lasting impact on the community.

The UK's High-Speed Rail (HS2) project has also been making headlines, with insiders saying that the project was "doomed to be a mess" due to a fundamental problem with the cost of building anything in the UK, as well as questions about the planning system. The project has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with some questioning whether it is worth the investment.

In international news, Ecuador's most notorious drug kingpin, Jose Alfredo "Fito" Salazar, has been extradited to the United States a month after he was recaptured following a prison escape that sparked a wave of violence across the country. The extradition comes as a significant blow to the drug lord, who was responsible for a significant amount of drug trafficking and violence in the region.

In conclusion, these recent news stories highlight the importance of addressing issues in the UK's pension system, the future of the NHS, and the impact of large-scale infrastructure projects. They also serve as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by countries in the region, including the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime.
