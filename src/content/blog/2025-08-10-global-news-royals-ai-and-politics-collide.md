**Israel Rebuffs International Criticism of Gaza City Plan**

Israel's defense minister has rejected international criticism of the country's plan to take over Gaza City, saying that countries that condemn Israel and threaten sanctions "will not weaken our resolve." The plan, approved by the Israeli security cabinet, aims to end the war in Gaza by disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and taking security control of the region.

**JD Vance and David Lammy's Unlikely Bond**

US Vice President JD Vance has been spotted on a UK holiday with Foreign Secretary David Lammy, sparking questions about their close relationship. Vance acknowledged that they come from "different political spectrums" but said Lammy had been "kind enough to make time on a visit to [Washington] DC, we got to know each other a little bit then." The unlikely friendship has sparked interest in the media and among the public.

**Newspaper Headlines: JD Vance Sends Warning to UK**

The Times features a photo of Vance and Lammy fishing at Chevening House, the foreign secretary's official country residence in Kent. Elsewhere, the paper notes that Vance sent a warning to the UK, but the exact nature of the warning remains unclear.

**Prince Andrew's Book Seals His Fate for Any Return**

Historian Andrew Lownie has written a biography about Prince Andrew, making some unflattering claims about the royal's behavior. The book alleges that Prince Andrew is rude, lacks self-awareness, and has been involved in numerous affairs. The publication of the book has sealed Prince Andrew's fate, making it unlikely that he will return to public life.
