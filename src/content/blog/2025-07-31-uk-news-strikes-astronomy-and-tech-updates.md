**Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

**United Kingdom**

The doctor strike in England has finally come to an end, but the dispute is far from over. After five days of walkouts, doctors are returning to work, and many are wondering if this is an opportunity for talks to restart. The strike, which is the 12th in the series, has seen doctors take to the streets to demand better pay and working conditions.

Meanwhile, the UK has made history by appointing its first female Astronomer Royal in 350 years. Prof Michele Dougherty, a renowned astronomer, is taking on the influential post and is committed to engaging with the public and making them aware of the importance of astronomy to the UK economy.

**Politics**

The UK's newspaper headlines have been dominated by the Prime Minister's decision to recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel ends the Gaza crisis. The Financial Times has featured Sir Keir's statement that Hamas must play "no part in the governance of Gaza," calling for them to disarm and release the remaining hostages.

**Technology**

YouTube has announced that videos with strong profanity in the first seven seconds, including the f-word, are now eligible for full ad revenue. This change is likely to impact the type of content creators produce, and some have welcomed the move as a step towards greater freedom of expression.

However, not all news in the tech world is good. Lovense, a sex toy maker, has been criticized for ignoring a security flaw that exposed users' email addresses for months. According to security researcher BobDaHacker, the flaw allowed him to generate someone's email address using their username and then take over their account.

These are just a few of the latest news stories from the world of business and artificial intelligence. Whether it's the ongoing doctor strike, the appointment of a new Astronomer Royal, or the latest developments in technology, there's always something new and interesting happening.
