**Global Business and AI News Update**

In the latest news, the world is witnessing significant developments in the fields of business, artificial intelligence, and international relations. From the high-stakes summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to concerns over cosmetic surgery abroad and the growing presence of data centers in the UK, it's been a busy week.

**US-Russia Summit in Alaska**

The much-anticipated summit between Presidents Trump and Putin has taken center stage, with the two leaders set to meet in Alaska to discuss a range of pressing issues, including the Ukraine war. The meeting marks the first time the two leaders have met in six years, and it's expected to be a crucial moment in efforts to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine.

**Concerns over Cosmetic Surgery Abroad**

Meanwhile, concerns are growing over the number of British citizens seeking cosmetic surgery abroad, with many falling victim to substandard treatments and procedures. The UK government has turned to social media influencers and TikTokers to advise on the risks and benefits of undergoing cosmetic surgery abroad, in a bid to educate the public on the potential consequences of such procedures.

**Data Centers to Expand Across UK**

Figures seen by the BBC suggest that the number of data centers in the UK is set to jump by a fifth in the coming years, with many of these centers privately funded by US tech giants. While some experts have warned that this could drive up prices paid by consumers, the expansion of data centers is likely to have significant implications for the tech industry and the UK economy.

**Divisions within Israel Over Gaza War**

In a separate development, BBC News correspondent Jeremy Bowen has been exploring the divisions within Israel over the war in Gaza. From protesters in "psychological despair" over the conflict to those who feel that their country's actions are justified, the views on this sensitive issue are deeply divided.

**Newspaper Headlines**

Finally, the Alaska summit has made headlines across the globe, with many newspapers previewing the high-stakes meeting between Trump and Putin. The BBC reports that Putin is "ready to make a deal" ahead of the summit, while the Guardian notes that the meeting comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and Russia.

In conclusion, this week's news has seen significant developments in the fields of business, artificial intelligence, and international relations. From the high-stakes summit between US and Russian leaders to concerns over cosmetic surgery abroad and the growth of data centers in the UK, it's been a busy and eventful week.
