**School Uniform Costs in England: A Growing Concern**
======================================================

In England, a significant number of councils are failing to provide grants to help families pay for school uniforms, leaving many students struggling. According to a recent report, only 22 out of 153 local education authorities in England offer a dedicated uniform grant, while a further seven provide assistance only in exceptional circumstances. This lack of support is a major concern, especially for low-income families who already face numerous financial challenges.

**Trump Surprises White House Press Corps with Rooftop Q&A**
=====================================================

In a surprise move, President Donald Trump took questions from the White House press corps on the rooftop of the White House. This unusual setting, which was captured on video, marked a departure from the usual formal press briefings. The move was seen as an attempt to humanize the President and provide a more relaxed atmosphere for journalists to ask questions.

**Zara Ads Banned for Featuring 'Unhealthily Thin' Models**
=====================================================

The advertising watchdog has banned Zara ads for featuring models who appear too thin. This decision follows similar bans on ads by other retailers, including Marks & Spencer and Next. The move aims to promote a more positive and realistic body image, and to prevent the glorification of unhealthy beauty standards.

**Weather Forecasting: Where Accuracy Meets Challenges**
=====================================================

Despite significant advances in weather forecasting, there are still challenges in sharing complex data with viewers. Forecasters are no longer just concerned with predicting whether there will be a heatwave, but also with explaining the underlying physics of the weather. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is promising in this regard, as it can help process large amounts of data and provide more accurate predictions.
