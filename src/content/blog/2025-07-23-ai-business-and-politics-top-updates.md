**Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

**NHS Strike Plan Raises Concerns**

The British Medical Association (BMA) has expressed concerns that a plan by NHS England to keep non-urgent services running during a strike by junior doctors and consultants may put patients at risk. In a letter sent to hospital managers, NHS England stated that rescheduling should only occur in exceptional circumstances and with its agreement. However, the BMA has expressed concerns that this plan may lead to a lack of adequate staffing and resources, potentially putting patients' health and safety at risk. The strike is set to take place in October, with union representatives citing concerns over working conditions, pay, and staffing levels.

**Smart Rings for Tracking Sleep and Health**

In the field of artificial intelligence, smart rings are gaining popularity as a comfortable and discreet alternative to smartwatches. The Verge has rounded up the best smart ring options from Oura, Samsung, Ultrahuman, and others. These rings can track sleep patterns, heart rate, and other health metrics, providing valuable insights for individuals looking to monitor their health and well-being. With the increasing use of AI-powered health tracking devices, smart rings offer a convenient and stylish way to stay on top of one's health.

**Ministers to Lose Exit Pay-Outs**

In a significant change to the rules governing ministerial exits, the UK government has announced that ministers will no longer receive severance payments equivalent to three months' salary when they leave office. The rule change, set to take effect in October, is part of a package of measures aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in government. The current system has been criticized for allowing ministers to receive significant payouts, regardless of the length of their tenure in office.

**Officer Convicted in Breonna Taylor Raid Receives 33-Month Sentence**

In a development related to the Breonna Taylor case, former Kentucky police officer Brett Hankison has been sentenced to 33 months in prison for his role in the raid that resulted in Taylor's death. The Trump administration had previously asked the judge to impose a sentence of one day behind bars, sparking criticism from Taylor's family and supporters. The sentence has been welcomed by some as a step towards accountability, while others have called for further action to address systemic racism and police brutality.

**Citizen App to Share Crime Videos with NYPD**

In a significant partnership between technology and law enforcement, the Citizen app has agreed to share crime videos with the New York City Police Department (NYPD). The deal enables real-time alerts from the city and direct access to videos posted by Citizen users. Mayor Eric Adams announced the partnership over the weekend, citing the potential benefits of increased transparency and collaboration between citizens and law enforcement. The partnership has raised concerns among privacy advocates, however, who have expressed concerns over the potential for misuse of personal data.

These recent developments in the fields of business, artificial intelligence, and current events highlight the complexities and challenges facing individuals and organizations in today's rapidly changing world. From the concerns over patient safety in the NHS to the potential benefits of smart rings and crime-fighting apps, these stories demonstrate the importance of staying informed and engaged with the latest news and updates.
