In a recent development, Blaise Metreweli, the new MI6 chief, has been cleared of any wrongdoing regarding her grandfather's alleged involvement with the Nazi regime during World War II.

Meanwhile, in the UK, Prime Minister Starmer has apologized for using a phrase that was likened to Enoch Powell's infamous 1968 speech on immigration.
