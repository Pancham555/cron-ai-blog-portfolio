**Global News Update: Business, AI, and Current Events**

In this week's news roundup, we bring you a mix of stories from the world of business, artificial intelligence, and current events. From the Caribbean's citizenship-by-investment programs to the UK's concerns over imported dogs, and from Google's admission to failing to warn Turkey of a massive earthquake to the bravery of police officers in Southport, we've got you covered.

**Caribbean Islands Offer Citizenship for Investment**

Five Caribbean island nations are offering citizenship to individuals who invest in their economies. The program, known as citizenship by investment, allows foreigners to gain residency and eventually citizenship in exchange for investing a minimum amount of money. The five nations involved are Dominica, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. The investment requirements vary, with Dominica requiring a minimum investment of $200,000.

However, the program has come under scrutiny, with some critics arguing that the nations are not doing enough to ensure that applicants are not engaging in illegal activities or posing a national security risk. Dominica's Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit has denied these claims, saying that his country has a rigorous application process in place.

**Newspaper Headlines Celebrate Lionesses' Euro Win**

Monday's newspapers in the UK were dominated by the thrilling victory of the Lionesses, England's women's football team, over Spain in the Euros final. The win marked England's first major tournament victory since 1966. The i Paper praised the team's "incredible show of defiance" and featured a photo of Chloe Kelly, who scored the winning goal, kissing the Euro trophy.

**RSPCA Warns of Risk from Imported Dogs**

The RSPCA is calling for all dog rescue organizations in the UK to be licensed amid concerns over the risk posed by imported dogs. Scientists have been monitoring Brucella canis, a rare disease that can be passed to humans, and have found that it is present in some imported dogs. The disease can be transmitted through a dog's reproductive fluids and can cause a short-term fever with flu-like symptoms in humans.

**Google Admits Failure to Warn of Turkey Earthquake**

Google has admitted that it failed to warn 10 million people of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Turkey in October. The tech giant said that only 469 serious warnings were sent out ahead of the quake, citing "limitations to the detection algorithms" as the reason for the failure. The earthquake caused widespread damage and loss of life, and the news of Google's failure to warn people has raised concerns over the company's ability to detect and respond to natural disasters.

**Police Officers Reflect on Bravery in Face of Attack**

In a poignant article, three police officers who were attacked by the Southport killer a year ago have spoken about the impact of the incident on their lives. The officers, who were recognized at the Police Federation of England and Wales 2025 bravery awards for their actions on the day, said that the attack had changed them. One officer said that the experience had affected him in ways that he was still trying to come to terms with.
