**Trump's Handling of Conspiracy Theories and International Crises**

In a recent podcast, Ezra Klein began by telling a joke that has been making the rounds. The joke revolves around a conspiracy theorist who dies and ascends to heaven, where God explains that as part of the celestial welcome, he will answer any question. However, the punchline highlights the irony that the conspiracy theorist has no questions to ask, as his entire life was consumed by lies and misinformation. This joke serves as a commentary on the consequences of spreading conspiracy theories, which can lead to a loss of credibility and trust.

In a separate development, CNN reports that California Democrats are debating what a potential governor run by Kamala Harris could mean for them. As Harris deliberates on whether to run for governor or hold out for another potential presidential bid, California Democrats are quietly asking themselves the same question. Harris's decision will have significant implications for the state's political landscape and may impact the party's chances in future elections.

**Tragedy Strikes in Dhaka**

In a tragic incident, a fighter jet crashed into a school in Dhaka, killing at least 31 people, many of whom were schoolchildren. One of the survivors, 11-year-old Wakia Firdous Nidhi, recalled the sound of the jet and the chaos that ensued. Her father, who was at prayer nearby, ran barefoot from the mosque as soon as he heard the commotion.

**Trump's Scottish Visit**

Meanwhile, US President Trump has arrived in Scotland for a two-day visit, during which he will play a round of golf at Turnberry and meet with the EU Commission president for trade talks. Security has been stepped up outside the hotel and a large fence has been erected around the golf course. Demonstrators have also gathered in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, protesting Trump's visit.

**Thailand and Cambodia Conflict**

As Trump golfs in Scotland, the US president has been in talks with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia about a ceasefire in their conflict. Trump emphasized that trade talks with both countries will not be possible until the fighting stops. The conflict has been ongoing for several days, with shelling continuing despite efforts to mediate a peace agreement.
