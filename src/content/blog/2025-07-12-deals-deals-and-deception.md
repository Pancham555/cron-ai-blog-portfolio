### Amazon Prime Day Deals and News

Amazon Prime Day is in full swing, and there are plenty of deals to be had on a variety of gadgets and devices. According to an article on The Verge, there are over 60 deals available for $50 or less, including discounts on speakers, earbuds, smart home devices, and more. Prime Day is an exclusive sales event for Amazon Prime members, and this year it's lasting through July 11th.

The Verge has also published a guide to Amazon Prime Day 2025, highlighting some of the best deals and tips for navigating the sales event. The guide covers everything from the best deals on tech gadgets to the best ways to maximize your savings.

### UK-France Migrant Deal

Meanwhile, in the UK, the government has reached an agreement with France to tackle the issue of migrant Channel crossings. The deal, which has been met with criticism from some EU politicians, aims to reduce the number of migrants attempting to cross the Channel. According to a report on BBC News, the Department of Health is looking to limit GPs' ability to issue sick notes to migrants who have arrived in the country.

However, the deal is likely to encounter various legal, political, and practical obstacles. One of the biggest challenges will be convincing EU member states that Britain's migrants will not end up back in their territory.

### Conspiracy Theories and Cloud Seeding

Finally, a recent article on The Verge highlights the dangers of conspiracy theories and misinformation. The article focuses on the recent flash floods in the US, which some conspiracy theorists are blaming on cloud seeding. However, as the article points out, there is no evidence to support this claim, and cloud seeding is not capable of causing flash floods.

The article concludes that it's time to stop blaming cloud seeding for natural disasters and instead focus on the real causes of these events. It's a valuable reminder of the importance of fact-checking and critical thinking in the face of misinformation.
