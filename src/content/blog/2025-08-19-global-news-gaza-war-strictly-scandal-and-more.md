**Global News Update: August 2025**

In this week's global news update, we're covering a range of topics from the Middle East to the Supreme Court in the United States. Here are the key stories:

**Huge Crowds Gather in Israel Demanding End to Gaza War**

Large crowds have gathered in Tel Aviv's "Hostages Square" to demand an end to the Gaza war and the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas. The protests were sparked by the national strike demanded by the families of the hostages. Meanwhile, Israeli far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich has denounced the protests, describing them as a "harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas."

**Met Police Investigating Strictly Come Dancing 'Drug Use' Claims**

The Metropolitan Police have confirmed that they are assessing whether there is evidence of a criminal offense being committed in connection with allegations of drug use on the TV show Strictly Come Dancing. The BBC launched an investigation earlier this month into alleged drug use by two unnamed stars of the show, which was prompted by a report in the Sun newspaper.

**Putin Agreed to 'Robust' Security Guarantees for Ukraine, Says US Envoy**

US envoy Steve Witkoff has revealed that Russia agreed to provide Ukraine with a NATO-style security guarantee in a meeting in Alaska. The guarantee would provide protection for Ukraine on land, in the air, and at sea, and would be developed with European partners.

**What Handing Donbas to Putin Would Mean for Ukraine**

Reports suggest that Donald Trump is planning to urge Ukraine to surrender the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as part of negotiations over an end to the war. However, Ukraine is deeply fatigued by the conflict, which has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians. The country is desperate for an end to the suffering, and any suggestion that it should give up territory to Russia is likely to be met with significant resistance.

**Supreme Court Could Scrap High-Profile Precedents**

The Supreme Court is set to reconvene this fall, and justices will have the opportunity to review and potentially scrap a range of high-profile precedents. This could include the landmark opinion on same-sex marriage, which was established in 2015. The court's decision could have significant implications for a range of issues, including equal rights and religious freedom.

These are just a few of the key stories from around the world this week. As always, we'll continue to monitor the latest developments and bring you updates as more information becomes available.
